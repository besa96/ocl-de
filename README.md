An attempt to parallelize the Differential Evolution Algorithm's C source code mentioned in the book; "Differential Evolution: In Search of Solutions" by Vitaliy Feoktistov, using OpenCL.

I couldn't test the results because I'm not mathematically inclined about the topic. All I did is to take the C code on the book and (try to) rewrite it in OpenCL. Thus comparing the results with the original code is not an option due to the Population being randomly generated on each run.

Some example outputs of various optimization functions are also included in the zip file.

## Requirements

* An OpenCL SDK

* Mersenne Twister Parameters generated by OpenCL PRNG Library. Already included a pre-generated one with the source.

## Libraries Used

* [OpenCL PRNG](http://mira.math.udel.edu/ParallelKMC/doku.php?id=projects:opencl_prng#opencl_prng) - Random Number Generator - Parallel Streams in OpenCL ; An OpenCL Parallel RNG library based on DCMT (Dynamic Creator of Mersenne Twisters). 

* [DCMT](https://github.com/MersenneTwister-Lab/dcmt) - May require the "Dynamic Creator of Mersenne Twisters" for up-to date headers for the OpenCL PRNG library above
